# COVID Predicition

In this project, we was able to using data science and machine learning tools to build a efficient model to decide if a patient has COVID-19 or not.

The NN was building using PyTorch and all documentation is also in repo.

## How to Executing?

Firstly, in PRE directory you can find EP2_PRE.ipynb script with data pre-processing, HC_Janeiro2021.zip dataset and dados_filtrados.csv file to input into NN.

You can easily executing the JN, because all dependencies are already in the directory.

Then, in NN directory, you can find EP2_NN.ipynb script with NN architecture and dados_filtrados.csv file to input into that.

You also can easily executing the JN, because all dependencies are already in the directory.

## More Information

You can obtain more info through report in REL directory.
