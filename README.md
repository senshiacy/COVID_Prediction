# COVID Prediction

In this project, we was able to using data science and machine learning tools to build a efficient model to decide if a patient has COVID-19 or not.

The NN was built using PyTorch and all documentation is also in repo.

## How to Executing?

Firstly, in PRE directory you can find EP2_PRE.ipynb script with data pre-processing, HC_Janeiro2021.zip dataset and dados_filtrados.csv file to input into NN.

You can easily execute the JN, because all dependencies are already in the directory.

Then, in NN directory, you can find EP2_NN.ipynb script with NN architecture and dados_filtrados.csv file to input into that.

You also can easily execute the JN, because all dependencies are already in the directory.

## About This Project and Results

In this project, we was able to use **PyTorch**, **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** and **Scikit-learn** to analyze, explore and visualize data insights, finding statistical patterns and select the best attributes, applying feature engineering. Additionally, we focused on neural network architecture looking for PyTorch structures (using PCA, standard scaler, ReLU algorithm and SGD optimizer) and evaluated our model by classical metrics
for classification predictor (using cross-validation, confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision and F1-score).

At the end, the COVID predictor performed **97.1%** in F1, **99.99%** in Accuracy, **95.77%** in Recall and **98.55%** in Precision score metrics, based on test data.
