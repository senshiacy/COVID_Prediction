# COVID Predicition

In this project, we was able to using data science and machine learning tools to build a efficient model to decide if a patient has COVID-19 or not.

The NN was building using PyTorch and all documentation is also in repo.

## How to Executing?

Firstly, in $\texttt{PRE}$ directory you can find $\texttt{EP2\_PRE.ipynb}$ script with data pre-processing, $\texttt{HC\_Janeiro2021.zip}$ dataset and $\texttt{dados\_filtrados.csv}$ file to input into NN.

You can easily executing the JN, because all dependencies are already in the directory.

Then, in $\texttt{NN}$ directory, you can find $\texttt{EP2\_NN.ipynb}$ script with NN architecture and $\texttt{dados\_filtrados.csv}$ file to input into that.

You also can easily executing the JN, because all dependencies are already in the directory.

## More Information

You can obtain more info through report in $\texttt{REL}$ directory.
